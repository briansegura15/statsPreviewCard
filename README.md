## My process

Opened up starter file and began analyzing design documents / redline. Began structuring HTML file and linked / imported required components found in started stylesheet. Once HTML was complete CSS was tackled until final design most closely resembled final product.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

Once again had the chance to work with Flexbox. (Im beginnning to think that this will be a reocurring theme in the web design world.) Also had the opportunity to give an existing image a color overlay. For the bottom stat section of the project I opted to use a table and was glad that it came out as I intended.
